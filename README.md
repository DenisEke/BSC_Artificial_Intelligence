Hey, in this repo I am collecting all the code I produce along my Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence

##Courses
Every directory in this folder is about 1 course. Here you can see my thoughts and comments about courses:

Computational Thinking: 
First course in which we had to code. It was required to comment everthing thats why there are so many comments. 
The most interesting code can be found in the hangman game.

Intro to python:
This is a course in the second period. I am not yet allowed to publish my code from this course. 
But here you can see what coding style I strive for. If you are interested in it I can send you a zip of workspace.
Just reach out.
